## Description 
This is a kata for the facturedo team, in order to learn and improve testing skills with python.

This is an small exercise, but the complete kata may be found in https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1

## Exercise

### 1. Create a simple String calculator with a method signature:

———————————————

int Add(string numbers)

———————————————

The method can take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and will return their sum. 

for example “” or “1” or “1,2” as inputs.

(for an empty string it will return 0) 

Hints:

——————

 - Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers

 - Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about

 - Remember to refactor after each passing test

### 2. Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers

### 3. Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001 = 2
